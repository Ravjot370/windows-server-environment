This is windows server environment project 
In this i have build a complete windows server environment for admin user and staff 
In part 1 i did hardware and software required for a business and its cost and purposed what to buy 
In part 2 i designed the Active directory part of the project OU’s and users along with permission for all the users and shared folder
in part 3 i implemented those plans and created the users and share permissions using windows server 2016
In last part i created OU’s and added user, and linked GPO to those OU’s and set up a web page 
I also used advance setting of IIS web service to set up a web page in windows server
